# Data script for paper "Rapid spatial assessment of leaf-absorbed irradiance"
# Data and Scripts Repository 

This repository contains processed environmental data and leaf temperature data, along with corresponding scripts, for three different plant species: tomato, cucumber, and sweet pepper. The organization of the repository is as follows:

"Tomato", "Cucumber", and "SweetPepper" folders: Each species has its dedicated folder containing specific data and scripts.

"Three distance" subfolder: Holds data on leaf placement at three different heights (30, 40, and 50 cm).

"Validation" subfolder: Contains data for plants subjected to one ordered light pattern and one random light pattern.

"Light map" subfolder: Includes data and scripts for generating the light map.

# The following folders are about "Method Application":

"Transpiration map" folder: Consists of raw data and scripts for generating tomato transpiration maps based on related light maps. Data for three repetitions is provided.

"Distinguish Lettuce Genotype" folder: Contains raw data and scripts for distinguishing between two lettuce genotypes based on their light map (light distribution). Data for four repetitions is provided.

# Large files link

To facilitate access and due to the large size of some original files, particularly the thermal time-lapse videos used for extracting raw temperature information, they are uploaded separately. You can find these files in the following link
